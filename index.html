            <b>C.V.RAMAN</b> ( 7 November 1888 â€“ 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering. Using a spectrograph that he developed,                  

he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and frequency. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown 

type of scattering of light, which they called "modified scattering" was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for the 

discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
           C. V. Raman was born in Tiruchirapalli in the Madras Presidency of British India (now Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India) to Tamil Brahmin parents,Chandrasekhara Ramanathan Iyer 

and Parvathi Ammal. He was the second of eight siblings. His father was a teacher at a local high school, and earned a modest income. He recalled: "I was born with a copper spoon in my 

mouth. At my birth my father was earning the magnificent salary of ten rupees per month!" In 1892, his family moved to Visakhapatnam (then Vishakapatnam, Vizagapatam or Vizag) in Andhra 

Pradesh as his father was appointed to the faculty of physics at Mrs A.V. Narasimha Rao College.
